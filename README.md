# DnD_Character_stats

Back in 2017, there was an article written on [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-your-dd-character-rare/) about how popular each of the Class and Race mixes were in D&D 5th Edition, acording to dndbeyond, the most popular site for creating D&D characters online. I, like many, was disapointed to discover that in a world filled with Elven Druids, Gnomes Warlocks, and Goliath Barbarians the most popular race and class mix was boring old Human Fighter. I wanted to dig deeper into this disappointing data, but struggled to find the data source, so I instead turned to Kaggle, where I found a [dataset claiming to have 1.2 miilion character from dndbeyond](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximebonnin/dnd-characters-test), and even though it's more like half a mllion after remvoing duplicates, that's still a lot of characters.



As a heads up, the Data Cleaner references data that is not available in this repository, as it is over twice the size allowed by GitHub for upload.
That data is available on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximebonnin/dnd-characters-test) page where I found the data, if you would like to recreate the data from scratch. I did remove some rozs that were taking up too much space as I had no plan to use them.
