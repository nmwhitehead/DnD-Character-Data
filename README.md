# DnD_Character_stats



As a heads up, the Data Cleaner references data that is not available in this repository, as it is over twice the size allowed by GitHub for upload.
That data is available on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximebonnin/dnd-characters-test) page where I found the data, if you would like to recreate the data from scratch. I did remove some rozs that were taking up too much space as I had no plan to use them.
